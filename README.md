get'em snitch
get'em snitch
get'em snitch

get'em snitch
get'em snitch
get'em snitch

get'em snitch
get'em snitch

get'em snitch

get'em sniiitch
get'em sniiitch
get'em sniiitch
get'em sniiitch
get'em sniiitch
get'em sniiitch yaaaa

prude bits brood bitch
suppress the flinch
such a glitch itch
x
the f the flinch
such a glitch itch
in your ditch bitch
x
the f the flinch
such a glitch itch
in your ditch bitch

trick is not to care about the dead
get in tha niche don't twitch your pits
i changed them y'all 
before you took the switch OFF

mid-zone approaching
blessed by a witch
bewitched in trance (entranced aye)
(bait and switch)
switch'em up


your chain got a chain to stitch

perfect miss
such a perfect miss ya

betting
abetting
so fitting
retros in fit/ting

inclusives
netting results 
from conscious forgetting

xxxxx

vetting
transmitting  

reseting
offsetting

committing
counterfeit bling


bridge
ridge
get
rich
bitch

hitch
itch

let'em
set  them
beget them
spread them
affect them
test them
suppress them
oppress them
detest them
perplex them

```

## Notes

## Music Video

Get'em Snitch - chase/tracking drone
brood bits brood bitch - target, broodmother
glitch itch - lots of static in footage
perfect miss - evaded the hunt
forgetting -  wiping footage memory

Geiger's Aliens vibe - THE BROOD

/// MOTHNODE_ Get'em Snitch [Prototype from Satsu Collab EP]

Current idea flow is purely base layer (base layers have direct meaning while top layer ideas are abstract) and ties a bit into Geiger's Alien vibes:
- "Snitch" is a chase/tracking drone.
- "Brood bits, brood bi**h" is the Alien's very own broodmother, which is the target in the music video. 
- "Glitch itch" - lots of static in footage. 
- "Perfect miss" - entity evaded the hunt 
- "forgetting" - wiping footage from memory

Quick prototype from an upcoming EP collaboration with 殺害Satsugaix666x. Mix of dark trap music and Alien Universe theme.

Music video in conceptual works. Current idea flow is purely base layer (base layers have direct meaning while top layer ideas are abstract) and ties into Geiger's vibes:
